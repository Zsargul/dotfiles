# Color Schemes

These files only contain the colour scheme parts of my various dot files. I tend to switch colour schemes often when messing around with my setup so I'm
just going to store the various colour schemes I have used over time here, as having to manually hand-pick colours when I get bored of my current one is
obviously troublesome. 

Here are screenshots of the various colour schemes I have saved here:
